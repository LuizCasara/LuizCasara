My name is Luiz Claudio Perin Casara, hailing from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), and I have been working as a Developer since 2015. Most of my experience comes from working with JS, ECS6, Node, React, React Native, Cypress, SQL, Postgress, and Oracle, and I am currently involved in front-end projects at (Dock)[dock.tech].

I am driven by new challenges, constantly looking for solutions to complex problems which others might avoid. I possess a unique ability to simplify complex explanations while ensuring attention is paid to detail. I always strive to question projects to ensure we deliver the best possible experience for the end-user.

I am eager to learn and discover new libraries and frameworks, and I love working with people to share problem-solving strategies, make new connections, and find out more about the applications and life in general.

ðŸ”­ At the moment, I am working on "how to create a good developer in my son" ðŸ˜†
ðŸŒ± Currently, I am learning AWS and Python
